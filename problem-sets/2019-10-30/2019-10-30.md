### Haunted Elevator

The Haunted Elevator belongs to a building that has no basement and will always start on floor 1.  
The first elevator press will move the elevator in the desired direction by 1 floor.  
If the elevator is on floor 1 and wants to go DOWN one step, the elevator is still on floor 1.  
The Haunted Elevator will reverse the direction after every other button press.

Parse each line of button presses, return the resulting floor that the elevator lands on, on it's own line.

Sample Input: `UP DOWN UP` will go UP 3 floors.  
Expected Output: `3`  

Sample Input: `DOWN UP UP UP DOWN`  
Expected Output: `1`  

Sample Input:
```
UP UP UP
UP UP DOWN UP UP
UP UP DOWN DOWN UP UP UP
```
Expected Output:

### superNATURALcase and spooKycaSe

superNATURALcase words are written with alternating all-caps and all-lowercase formats, starting with lowercase, and no other space separators.

spooKycaSe words are written with each second-to-last letter being uppercased, and no other space separators.

Read each line from standard input.  
Each line of text will be either superNATURALcase or spooKycaSe.

Print out the same lines with text transformed to Sentence case.  
Keep all punctuations as is.

Sample Input:
```

```

Expected Output:
```
What shape was this who came to us,
With basilisk eyes so ominous,
With mouth so sweet, so poisonous,
And tortured hands so pale?
We saw her wavering to and fro,
Through dark and wind we saw her go;
Yet what her name was did not know;
And felt our spirits fail.
