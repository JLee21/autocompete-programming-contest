### Mummies in a Pyramid

Write a program called `pyramid` that reads a single integer from standard input  
then print out a pyramid (using asterisks) that encloses mummies (using $ symbol)  
Mummies should never be outside or on the edge of the pyramid.  
Tests will run against integers from 1-100 inclusive

Sample Input: `1`  
Expected Output :
```

Sample Input: `2`  
Expected Output :

### Haunted Elevator

The Haunted Elevator belongs to a building that has no basement and will always start on floor 1.  
The first elevator press will move the elevator in the desired direction by 1 floor.  
If the elevator is on floor 1 and wants to go DOWN one step, the elevator is still on floor 1.  
The Haunted Elevator will reverse the direction after every other button press.

If the elevator never got haunted here is how it would react to someone pressing UP DOWN UP

- The elevator starts at floor 1
- Pressing UP moves the elevator from floor 1 to floor 2
- Pressing DOWN moves elevator from floor 2 back to floor 1
- Pressing UP moves the elevator from floor 1 to floor 2

But, that's not how things go. This elevator gets haunted every other the button is pressed and the elevator goes in the opposite direction of the button that's pressed.

- The elevator starts on floor 1 and is not haunted.
- Pressing UP causes the elevator to go from floor 1 to 2 it is now haunted.
- Pressing DOWN causes the haunted elevator to go from floor 2 to 3 and now it is not haunted.
- Pressing UP causes the un-haunted elevator to go from floor 3 to floor 4.
- The elevator went from floor 1 to floor 4 for a total of 3 floors.

Parse each line of button presses, return the resulting floor that the elevator lands on, on it's own line.

Sample Input: `UP DOWN UP` will go UP 3 floors.  
Expected Output: `3`  

Sample Input: `DOWN UP UP UP DOWN`  
Expected Output: `1`  

Sample Input:
```
UP UP UP
UP UP DOWN UP UP
UP UP DOWN DOWN UP UP UP
```
Expected Output:

### superNATURALcase and spooKycaSe

superNATURALcase words are written with alternating all-caps and all-lowercase formats, starting with lowercase, and no other space separators.

spooKycaSe words are written with each second-to-last letter being uppercased, and no other space separators.

Read each line from standard input.  
Each line of text will be either superNATURALcase or spooKycaSe.

Print out the same lines with text transformed to Sentence case.  
Keep all punctuations as is.

Sample Input:
```

Expected Output:
```
What shape was this who came to us,
With basilisk eyes so ominous,
With mouth so sweet, so poisonous,
And tortured hands so pale?
We saw her wavering to and fro,
Through dark and wind we saw her go;
Yet what her name was did not know;
And felt our spirits fail.
