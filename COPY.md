Calling all Bootcamp students! Budding programmers! Junior developers! Code
fellows!

We’re organizing a fun programming contest. Come have a blast and prove your
chops. We’re hosting it at Flatiron School located downtown by Westlake Park on
4th and Union. Teams of up to three people will compete to solve the most
programming problems in the least amount of time.

Check out the programming problems from the last time we did this:

There’s one stipulation: each team must use only one computer. Be ready to
collaborate writing programs with pencil and paper to prove your ideas to each
other. You may use any language you want. Programming languages we prioritize
include Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. If you want to use another language
(Java? C#? Rust? Julia? Haskell?) just let us know so we can prepare.

Coordinate with friends to put a team together, or show up by yourself and
we’ll make sure you’re matched well.

This is a generic programming contest for anyone programming. Whether you’re a
web developer, data scientist, or whatever, come over and have a good time.

We will provide pizza, soda, and beer!

# What to Expect
Create a team of up to three people and come up with a fun name. You’ll work
together poring over a pack of paper-printed programming problems. The problems
vary in their degree of difficulty. They will describe certain problem input.
You three must work together to create a program that takes the problem input
and computes the appropriate problem output.

Each team is allowed only one laptop. Teams may program in JavaScript, Ruby or
Python (if you plan to use another language please let us know). Teams are
allowed access to the internet (but we don’t think it will help much). Teams
will have access to pen and paper. Since there’s only one laptop allowed per
team we expect teams to be writing programs with pencil and paper before they
enter the program in the laptop (if they want to streamline their
competitiveness!)

For example, a problem might say “Create a program that reads from STDIN. Each
line will contain a dollar amount and a name of a movie. These represent
theater ticket sales. Movies may repeat on multiple lines, representing the
same movie being shown at multiple theaters. Your program should compute the
total dollar amounts associated with each movie and print out the box office
total for the highest grossing movie. The box office total must be printed with
a preceding “$” dollar sign, comma-separated digits, and two
properly-zero-padded digits for cents.

Sample Input
$14,220.88 Gone with the Wind
$23,988.00 Pirates of Silicon Valley
$31,000.02 Pirates of Silicon Valley

Sample Output
$54,988.02 Pirates of Silicon Valley

All teams will have one hour to solve as many problems as possible. The winner
will be determined by which team solves the most problems, combined with how
long it took the team to solve each problem.  “Cumulative time” has a slightly
strange definition. It’s the sum of every timestamp at the moment of problem
submission. If you solve one problem at minute 14 and a second problem at
minute 22 your total time is the sum of those two: 14 + 22 = 36 minutes.

Observe the following:
* Team A solves #4 at 00:14, #2 at 00:23 and #5 at 00:52
* Team A has a score of 3 problems solved with :14 + :23 + :52 = 89 minutes
* Team B solves #5 at 00:32, #3 at 00:36 and #2 at 00:52
* Team B has a score of 3 problems solved with :32 + :36 + :52 = 120 minutes
* Team A wins because they solved the same number of problems with less cumulative time.

First, Second and Third place teams will receive prizes. Prizes include
Flatiron swag, bragging rights, a legitimate “I placed Nth in a programming
contest” line-item to put on your resume, and direct social media promotion via
LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram.  Come get your practice on now!

Meet us on the 13th floor when you arrive!
